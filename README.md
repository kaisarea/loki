Compensating Wage Differentials Experiment
===============================================
Experiment proposals for measuring the differentials:

1. child mollestation
2. write to an African American prisoner
3. autopsy
4. work for an evil company
5. anorexia
6. internet piracy research

Internet Piracy Research
========================
- research intellectual property rights theft incidents and activities on the internet
- dangerous (first motivation for CWD), by surfing users can contract viruses,
	malware, users can be asked to download and test the material they find
- read An Introduction to the Law and Economics of Intellectual Property, Besen and Raskind 1991,
	Journal of Economic Perspectives as a training, quiz designed from this document
- How to create multiplicity of tasks? 100 per person?
- We can do it by content. Say 100 different movies. Every worker would be tasked
	to research the extent of copyright infringement involving that particular 
	movie, write down the website


African American Prisoners
==========================
- write an African American prisoner
- real profiles easy to find on the internet, multiplicity of tasks easy to achieve
- racist content as dishonorable, workers will be told it comes from Ku Klux Klan
- comforting content as honorable, profiles will be the same for both treatment and control
- training can be extracts from books about Jim Crow or the New Jim Crow

Work for an evil company
=========================
- the biggest challenge is to create multiplicity of tasks and to avoid being
	sued by the evil company in question
