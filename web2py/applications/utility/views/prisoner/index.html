    <h2>Guidelines for Writing to a Prisoner</h2>
    <p>
        Before you embark on this assignment we want you to learn and verify 
        your understanding of the basic guidelines involved in this task.
        Incoming mail shall be disapproved if any part of it:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Depicts or describes procedures for the construction of or use of 
            weapons, ammunitions, bombs, chemical agents, or incendiary devices;
        <li>Depicts, encourages, or describes methods of escape from correctional 
            facilities or contains blueprints, drawings or similar descriptions of 
            department of corrections facilities or institutions, or includes road 
            maps that can facilitate escape from correctional facilities;
        <li>Connotes the idea that the prisoner would suffer more punishment
            in the afterlife or that the punishment he is suffering is
            insufficient;
        <li>Depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic 
            beverages, or the manufacture of drugs or other intoxicants;
        <li>Is written in code;
        <li>Depicts, describes or encourages activities which may lead to the 
            use of physical violence or group disruption;
        <li>Encourages or instructs in the commission of criminal activity;
        <li>Is dangerously inflammatory in that it advocates or encourages 
            riot, insurrection, disruption of the institution, violation of 
            department or institution rules, the violation of which would 
            present a serious threat to the security, order or rehabilitative 
            objectives of the institution or the safety of any person;
        <li>Threatens physical harm, blackmail or extortion;
        <li>Be rude or disrespectful;
        <li>Attacks people. Disagree with someone’s idea? That’s fine. Attack the person? No way;
        <li>Write racial, ethnic, gender or obscene comments. Hopefully that 
            needs no further explanation;
        <li>Post anything you don’t have the right to post. That includes 
            trademarked or private information, or personal information 
            belonging to someone else;
        <li>Discourages the prisoner from successfully continuing in his civil
            life upon release;
        <li>Lacks enthusiasm and positive outlook;
        <li>Describes an illegal activity in a positive way leading to distortion
            in role model creating process on the side of the prisoner;
        <li>Undermines the correctionary process the prisoner is undergoing
            in the correction facility;
        <li>Undermines the belief on the part of the prisoner that after paying
            his debt to the society he will not be able to become an equal 
            member of the society;
        <li>Contains criminal history, offender registration, or other personal 
            information about another inmate or offender which, in the hands of 
            an inmate, presents a threat to the security, order or rehabilitative 
            objectives of the correctional system or to the safety of any person;
        <li>It contains an advertisement promoting any of the following 
            where the advertisement is the focus of, rather than being 
            incidental to, the publication or the advertising is prominent 
            or prevalent throughout the publication.
            <ul>
                <li>Three-way calling services;
                <li>Pen-pal services;
                <li>The purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or
                <li>Conducting a business or profession while incarcerated 
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>On the other hand, the letter will receive better evaluation grade if
        it attempts to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>persuade, or convince the prisoners, to take action to improve;
        <li>convince the prisoner that increased effort and energy will lead 
            to improved performance;
        <li>provide an outline of the problem and the benefits of change which 
            will require elements of conviction, direction, intensity and 
            persistence from the speaker in their efforts to persuade the 
            prisoner to take a pro-active approach;
        <li>establish credibility by demonstrating expertise, evidence and 
            knowledge of the prisoner's situtation - presenting facts, 
            statistics or quotes together with any personal experiences;
        <li>make the audience believe that there is a problem which requires 
            solving;
        <li>provide ideas and direction to solve the problem;
        <li>convey the subject with enthusiasm, passion and intensity to appeal 
            to the emotions of the prisoner;
        <li>comes across as truthful and sincere. Insincere and artificial 
            sounding talk will be obvious to the prisoner and not achieve 
            the desired results;
        <li>Humor truly is the best medicine. People love to laugh. Chances are, 
            the letter-writers who are most memorable to you are those who conveyed 
            their message and were able to do it with humor. Letters should 
            contain a good bit of humor. After all, motivation is all about 
            uplifting the prisoner, and what better way than with humor?
        <li>Include practical anecdotes from your own life. The prisoners will 
            be able to relate to you as a regular person who has been through 
            and overcome tough times. This will help you develop an instant 
            rapport with the prisoner. Prisoner has to be able to identify 
            with you if you are going to create a genuine connection with them. 
            There is nothing more inspiring for the prisoners, than to realize 
            that the person who is writing them has actually made it through 
            and become successful. They will get the feeling that if you can 
            go through what you did and came out on the other side successfully 
            they will believe they can too.
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Testing Your Understanding of the Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        You will be presented a series of letters from fictitious
        workers to prisoners and are asked to evaluate them.
    </p>
    <form>
    <ul>
        <li><p>"Dear Carlos,<br>
                I cannot possibly comprehend how a human being might be 
                capable of doing what you did. However, you were justly
                convicted and you are paying your debt to society.
                So I guess it would be wrongful of me to deny you 
                my friendship. On the other hand, it is not quite
                clear whether you have been praying to God to ask 
                you forgiveness and whether it will be granted to you.
                I guess it all depends on the entirety of your life,
                personality and actions. Anyway, I find difficult to relate to you
                as a person. Neverthless, I would like to say that I hope
                that you won't deviate from the righteous path again
                and pray for God's forgiveness. Dabit deus his quoque 
                finem.<br>
                <br>
                Yours Truly,<br>

                Your only crime is that you got caught! There is a lot of white-collar
                folks steeling megabucks from people in investment banks 
                and other garbage corporations. Politicians fool people all
                the time and cash in on it. Your only crime was that you didn't
                think big and you didn't have the right friends in the right places!
                They put you in that position, man! It ain't your fault!
                Next time you just gotta be smarter, don't steal pennies, steal
                big! Don't lie just in the court room, lie all the time!
                That's how the white people do it!<br>

    Inmates need moral support outside of prison
    walls. Research shows that inmates with positive contacts outside
    of prison are less likely to return to prison, crime, and substance
    abuse, and more likely to find a job upon release.
