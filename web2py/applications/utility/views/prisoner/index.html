    <h2>Training Guidelines for Writing a Prisoner</h2>
    <p>
        You must learn these rules to write prisoners.
        Your letter will be rejected if it:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic 
            beverages, or the manufacture of drugs or other intoxicants;
        <li>Is written in code;
        <li>Depicts, describes or encourages activities which may lead to the 
            use of physical violence or group disruption;
        <li>Encourages or instructs in the commission of criminal activity;
        <li>Be rude or disrespectful;
        <li>Write racial, ethnic, gender or obscene comments. Hopefully that 
            needs no further explanation;
        <li>Discourages the prisoner from successfully continuing in his civil
            life upon release;
        <li>Lacks enthusiasm and positive outlook;
        <li>Describes an illegal activity in a positive way leading to distortion
            in role model creating process on the side of the prisoner;
        <li>Undermines the correctionary process the prisoner is undergoing
            in the correction facility;
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Testing Your Understanding of the Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Read each of these ficticious letters, and identify the rules
        they violate.
    </p>
    <form>
    <ul>
        <li><p>"Dear Carlos,<br>
                I cannot possibly comprehend how a human being might be 
                capable of doing what you did. However, you were justly
                convicted and you are paying your debt to society.
                So I guess it would be wrongful of me to deny you 
                my friendship. On the other hand, it is not quite
                clear whether you have been praying to God to ask 
                you forgiveness and whether it will be granted to you.
                I guess it all depends on the entirety of your life,
                personality and actions. Anyway, I find difficult to relate to you
                as a person. Neverthless, I would like to say that I hope
                that you won't deviate from the righteous path again
                and pray for God's forgiveness. Dabit deus his quoque 
                finem.<br>

    Inmates need moral support outside of prison
    walls. Research shows that inmates with positive contacts outside
    of prison are less likely to return to prison, crime, and substance
    abuse, and more likely to find a job upon release.
