    {"bio": "Hi everybody. Thank you for having a look at my profile. What I believe: I believe &#8220;GOD&#8221; is the father of All Creations who Created the Heavens and earth. My 53 years on this planet as a male & a Christian had made me believe God is a male. Now I believe God is both neutral and both genders. I believe GOD is too immense for us to know fully. &#8220;God&#8221; is beyond comprehension. I believe there is also other dimensions of time & space that are ruled by creatures beyond human understanding with high technology development. I believe GOD knows All and works within the alliance of coexisting types of living beings in a supreme republic of all life forms. I believe human kind has yet to imagine possible the alternate forms but such living entities have been guests to and inhabited the material matter of the earth. I believe all life energies are infinite and transform states despite science phenomena. Last but not the end, I believe in One Nation under GOD with Liberty & Justice Of which I have defended for many of the best years of my life as did our fore father&#8217;s. I believe in better days just one at a time will happen and I believe in hope and I will improve. I believe in true love, with my heart I hope to find one woman who I can devote myself and be my wife. I believe GOD guides my path. Someday I can build a family & real companionship, & a home again. Someday I can build the machines in my dreams & memory. Someday, I can work hard and accomplish great deeds that benefit the earth. Me, I am a warm person with lots of love in my heart. I am cultured with a strong intellect. I am very truthful and I been living in integrity. I am very loyal & do my best everyday to be better and care about others well beings. I try to contain my loneliness and restructure my complete person to get ready for when I am freed. I try to be hopeful that people on the outside world are not like all the people here, that is most because it is concentrated here with people like this. I hope to be with positive people more often, that can happen with help from the outside. ",

However as of late I have turned a new leaf to experience unique paths and open previously locked doors to see where I may end up. So this is how I find you today. So with that out the way I&#8217;ll start here with a more proper greeting. I&#8217;ve been incarcerated since 2009 but as of 2015 a new journey will begin for me beyond these walls.  This is my other reason for visiting this site, the reconstruction of my circle of relationships which is instrumental for any person departing prison. My traits are too many to list here and sharing them would honestly be an underscore, but to fulfill the invitation of correspondence the exploitation of some virtues are definitely required. I am a person who always cares for his neighbor (so to speak), natural, considerate, appropriate, and one that I believe shows most clearly is that I strive to live without regrets. To conclude this introduction I hope I have ignited a tiny flame of interest for you to desire to learn about me and what may be a new beginning for us. ",

Longing is too difficult if you focus on the despair it brings. It keeps reminding you of what is missing, what you&#8217;ve lost holding you in a graveyard. Again, the question I have for you is &#8220;What is longing?&#8221; To state it directly, longing without hope is the beginning of misery. I&#8217;m intelligent, fun and cute. I am lucky because my needs are taken care of; regardless, there are things I want. Prison isn&#8217;t difficult, but it would be better if I got mail! Kindness and friendly words go a long way with me. The only thing I need is someone who listens well. One week has 168 hours. Are you a lady who could spare one of them to write me?
