I’m Marcus J. T. and I’m from Portland, Maine. I’m 45 years old, 6’5 and weigh 220 pounds –big and

greats. But there’s something I’m still lacking even after all this time, and that’s a genuine 
love with a woman where we can be forthcoming and respectful about our past mistakes or triumphs, 
our hopes and dreams, etc. I just need a chance to prove myself as somebody who’s worth taking 
the time to trust with your heart. I have a bit of a formula for the sort of relationship I’m seeking. 
It’s companionship-honesty-faithfulness-open to listening-and talking. If you’d like to write me, 
it would be great if you could send an up-to-date photo of yourself along with your response.

these people in here. I gotta be me. Most people like me for that. I’ve messed up 
in the past but I’m busy learning from my mistakes. I exercise and do artwork in 
my free time. I also cut hair and I love it. I really want to go to school to become

online. Before my incarceration I worked in the legal field and helped with events

I’m doing this because I’m interested in trying new things and meeting new people, 
but I should begin by telling you about myself. 

I’m half Scottish and half French. The sentence I’m serving, 8 years, is for a crime 
that did not involve violence. Since getting in here, I’ve been spending my days 
playing ball, going to the gym, and making friends on the outside. (You can’t do much 
in here.) I’ve almost served all of my time, so now I’m planning my next steps. 

I want to be a cook and I used to work with my hands. I was born near the ocean so I 
pine for anything ocean-related...boogie boarding, kayaking, I love it all. 

I hope this profile description will suffice. Looking forward to talking with you.

{"bio" : """What’s happening?! I’ll get the ball rolling by describing myself a bit. 
If you have any questions, you know how to contact me. I’ll be listening. 
First off, I’m part European and part Native American. I was raised on the Makah 
Indian Reservation in Washington state. I’m part of the Makah Tribe of the forest. 
My tribe and my ancestors make me feel very proud. I’ve spent most of my life in 
Washington. I’ve also stayed in places like California, Texas, and Utah. As soon 
as I get out of prison I’ll go back to Washington. I’m not sure how long that will be. 
My interests in here mostly center on books and exercising. I find that each of 
those pastimes strengthens me in important ways. Time passes much more quickly 
when I keep myself occupied. I love making new friends and having conversations. 
I also try to influence the people around me by setting a good example...I believe 
it is important to be the change I hope to see in the world. 
I’m looking to form some friendships for the three years I have left of my sentence. 
My best qualities are faithfulness and honesty. 
To sum up, I hope you found me interesting. Also if you end up striking a friendship 
with me, you’ll be happy you did. 
I appreciate your reading this.

What’s up all you wonderful people? Just wanted to let you know I appreciate you. 
Hanging out on your laptop, reading all this. I’m really thankful for that. Allow 
me to tell you about myself. You can figure out my original name. But I am called 
Clay N. I grew up on a beautiful Caribbean Island. You might be able to tell that 
by looking at me. I’m 6’1, 175 pounds, and 26 years old. I like making people laugh. 
Very kind and self assured. Outgoing, and strong in body, mind, and spirit. I’m 
very principled and have a strong moral code, and I’m faithful to a fault!
I’m searching for a genuine companion who’s interested in forming a real companionship 
with me. If that doesn’t sound like you, just move on now. I don’t want either of us 
to spend time on each other if you’re not in it. I don’t care about race. I don’t care 
what you look like. I don’t care how big you are. What I care about it, you’re honest 
and you’re not into drama. Because I’m honest, and I’m not into drama. 
Right now I’m in prison currently. I’m here on charges of theft, but be open-minded. 
I’ve learned a lot since then. I’m very different now. My sentence is 25 years, so 
I have ten remaining. But I also made an appeal and I’m excited to go back for more 
legal proceedings. My birthday is 10-03-87. I used to live in Georgia and that’s where 
I’ll be going when I get out. At the moment I’m supposed to get out on 04-27-24.""",

You may be curious about what made me write a profile – it’s probably for the same 
reasons you’re looking at it, because I’d like to meet someone new and different.

Grin because I laugh a lot. I may be in prison, but I still try to stay optimistic
