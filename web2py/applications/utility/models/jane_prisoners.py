I'm a good guy who did wrong and now I'm making it right. 
I hope that's good enough.

I’m a relatively successful tattoo artist. My work has been 
featured in tons of magazines and I was interviewed for a 
documentary once. I've got a big personality and I love to 
put on a good show, so people like me generally and I have 
a lot of lifetime customers. I'm taking business classes so 
that when I get out I can open up my own shop. That's whats up! 

Honestly I'm getting a little bored in here. Any message
from the outside would be very refreshing from the dull
routine in here. I appreciate every minute you spend on me.

"""Hey world! Tell me something good! 
My name is Daniel and I'm better known as D-bro. I’m 32 
years old and was born and raised by my momma, my grandmomma, and my 
aunt in the deep south. Hense my old southern morals and gentleman like 
behavior. Even though I come up out of the south I'm clean. Like I said, 
I was brought up by a household of females. They taught me to keep 
up with my health and personal hygiene so I could be presentable. 
Even though I was brought up in a decent fashion I somehow went 
astray. Before this I didn’t know just how lucky I was to have a momma 
and aunt and a grandmomma that cared about me like that. But I'm sorry 
and now I always think about how my actions will effect my family.

My interests are low riders and old-school cars, listening to good 
music, and pretty much everything put out by Tyler Perry (especially 
the House Of Payne show). The greatest books that I’ve ever read are 
MLK's biography and Something to Prove. I enjoy spending time with 
my family like having cookouts and family get-togethers with them. 
I sit back and enjoy a Segrams and juice from time to time. I love 
home cooking and soul food, especially fried chicken and greens 
with bacon. My auntie taught me how to cook and I'm pretty decent 
at it. And baking too.

I’ve been trying to make to most of prison and have taken pretty much 
every class offer. I got my GED and a certificate in commercial 
labor. I learned speed typing, graphic design, television repair, 
painting, yoga, food service technology, botanical maintenance, 
and intro to needlework. I'm looking to correspond with 
someone who will do everything they can to help me accomplish 
my goals once I get out of prison. If you like what you know about me 
so far, I hope you will establish communication with me soon. 
Until then be God-fearing and true to your family and friends.
