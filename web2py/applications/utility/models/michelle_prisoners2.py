  {"bio" : """Wanted: a nice soul open to sharing their ideas, 
interests, feelings, experiences, and anything else. If you are 
serious about writing me, that is all that matters. 

Hello! My name is Edgar. I love meeting and connecting with people 
and forming lifelong friendships. I live my life with happiness 
and gratitude for each gift I receive everyday. I try to stay 
positive and devote myself to caring for true friends and those 
closest to me. Hobbies: having fun, laughing, cooking, writing 
and taking photos. Interests: animal rights (I love all animals, 
even small ones like birds and mice) football and baseball. 
I believe in fate. If you write me, we will connect in the way 
only we were meant to.""", "name" : "Edgar G."},

{"bio" : """Well I would like to get some mail and even make a good 
friend. There are alot of people here with bad attitudes. I see 
it everyday. I want to talk with someone different with a nice 
sense of humor and positive attitude. You must be mature, 
open to new ideas, and relaxed. I am a good listener so if 
people say you talk too much or are very bubbly we may be 
a great match.

I am from Western Montana. I love being outside and staying 
active. In here I try to use most of my free time exercising 
and playing sports. I also like to watch movies and read 
when I’m inside. I have at least 20 tattoos from my legs 
to my neck. If you don’t like tattoos maybe you should write 
someone else.

I would love to write you if you have a positive mindset 
like me. So please send a letter and say hi.""", "name" : "Gerald R."},

{"bio" : """I’m single and don’t have kids. I like exploring, 
fun, and being spontaneous. I’m a relaxed guy and I like 
making people laugh with my great sense of humor. I love 
kids and cooking for people. I read many 
types of books. I get very enthusiastic about music! Jazz, 
Latin and R&B are my favorites.

I want to make friends with chill people. Race, weight, and 
age don’t matter to me because I think all people are beautiful. 
If you are thoughtful and fun you are just right for me. 
It would be good if you like sharing and would introduce me 
to new interests. When I am released I want to be more fulfilled 
and do things I have never experienced. So I would love to 
hear about your life and great things I can do when I am 
released. I am excited to hear from you...""", "name" : "James E."},

{"bio" : """Maybe like me you are not sure about having a 
pen pal. Well I want to say that if you want to write to me at all, 
do it. I will win you over with my smile, intellect, confidence 
and big ego... LOL... and my sarcasm. Are you smiling?? Even a 
little? Write me then!!! LOL. I am a very down to earth person. 
So don’t judge a book by it’s cover... unless it looks good to you. 
Guess what my favorite hobby is? Fishing. And my favorite music 
is classical. No I’m pulling your leg. I like these things... but I 
like lots of things. I have very eclectic tastes.

It is funny to me that as a man I was always used to being 
the one to start a conversation with people but now I am 
waiting for you to talk to me. So I guess it’s like we’ve 
traded roles. I hope you think that is interesting. You 
know in my current place in life I have learned that everyone wants 
more positivity in their lives. So I try to make people laugh 
and smile. I write letters that to do both. So if you are not smiling, 
read my profile again... and then I hope I am the person you want to 
write a letter to... you should write to whoever you feel a 
connection with... and I hope it is me... I’m just saying!!!""",

{"bio" : """Thank you truly for looking at my profile. I very 
much hope that we can begin a lasting friendship, and it all 
begins here. I’m a strong Aquarius. I will always strive to 
dream big and turn those dreams into reality. I live by my 
principles, and although I have made mistakes I learn from 
them so that they make me stronger. I devote myself to my 
family and friends and they do the same for me. My interests 
include cooking and football. I’d like to find a friend that’s 
grounded, savvy and on top of her game. I don’t mind if 
she’s somewhat cuckoo as long as she means well. I love 
Jesus, and would hope she does, too. Have faith, be brave, 
take a chance and contact me so we can find out what is 
in store for us.""", "name" : "Arthur J."},

{"bio" : """Hello, my name is Jack. I would like to get some 
mail from future friends. I like learning about different 
ways of life and cultural beliefs. For this reason, I would 
enjoy talking to people from the US or abroad. I am Native 
American and can share stories of growing up on a reservation. 
I’m 36 and I don’t have any children. I enjoy watching most 
sports on television, especially soccer and motor racing. I 
also like to camp, hike, and look at the stars. Right now I’m 
working and gaining skills in accounting through a private 
company. I look forward to being released so I can work at 
businesses closer to my home. I appreciate that you have 
taken this time to learn about me. If you are interested in 
sharing and good conversation, contact me so we can 
talk more. Thank you.""", "name" : "Jack R."},

{"bio" : """Hello Everyone! Not everything is serendipity as 
the movies would make us think.  I am taking the first step 
to find someone, a new friend. That’s not wrong, is it? Perhaps 
you are looking as much as I am. I want a friendship that 
is totally honest. That is also something you can count on 
from me: honesty. I have too many hobbies to mention here, 
so reach out to me if you want to know more. I welcome anyone 
to write to me. I am waiting for you now!""", "name" : "Leopold N."},

{"bio" : """Greetings, I’m Hector. I appreciate you taking 
the time to read this. I would like to find a friend to write 
to and even speak on the phone with sometimes. It’d be good 
for me to chat with people who live normal lives, and know 
what is going on in the world, and can give decent advice. 
As for me, I like Hiking, climbing and swimming in the great 
outdoors. When I am released I want to open a tattoo parlor. 
I have been doing them for fifteen years and it is a joy. 
I love looking at great art works. Art has been my thing since 
I was a kid drawing pictures at school and making paintings for 
my mom. (RIP mom.) Now as you can see from my pictures, I am 
almost totally covered with tattoos. Hope to hear from you soon. 
God bless.""", "name" : "Hector W."}]
