         "description": """Bridgestone began receiving complaints about their Firestone 
                tires treads' tendency to separate, often resulting in horrific accidents, 
                starting in 1998. But they refused to admit that there was a real 
                problem until 2000, when the NHTSA launched a large-scale investigation. 
                After much waffling in the press, Bridgestone finally accepted blame, 
                and on August 9, 2000, they announced the recall of 6.5 million tires -- 
                the second-largest recall in U.S. history. According to CBS News, the 
                NHTSA eventually announced that nearly 200 deaths and more than 700 
                injuries had been caused by the faulty tires."""},

         "description": """Can you put a positive spin on smoking deaths? Philip Morris 
                thought so, when they released the results of a study conducted in 
                the Czech Republic proving that smokers' deaths had positive effects 
                financially for the Czech government. According to CNN, the tobacco 
                giant conducted the study in response to the Czech government's argument 
                that the financial costs of smoking outweighed its benefits. Not so, 
                said Philip Morris: smoking actually resulted in a net gain of 
                around $147 million, including saving `between 943 million and 1.2 
                billion korunas (about $24 million-to-$30 million) in health-care, 
                pension and public-housing costs due to the early deaths of smokers.'
                The company, of course, faced a huge public backlash as a result of 
                the release, which was intended to create positive PR for an 
                already-struggling industry. CBS News reports that it also subsequently 
                canceled its plans for similar studies in other countries."""},

	 "description" : """Even though preliminary studies in 2000 had suggested that painkiller Vioxx posed a 
		potential heart health risk, executives at pharmaceutical giant Merck chose not to pursue those 
		studies further. Four years later, Merck was forced to recall that very drug because of evidence 
		that it may have caused heart attacks and cardiac deaths in thousands of its users. The recall 
		turned into a massive scandal as reports came out that Merck had known about the serious risk, 
		yet continued to promote the drug anyways. The company faced an SEC investigation and hundreds 
		of lawsuits as a result of its actions. The scandal was finally laid to rest in 2009, according 
		to the Wall Street Journal, when Merck settled litigation for $80 million."""}]
