My stint in prison has provided me an opportunity to propose forming a 
friendship with anyone who may be interested in building a bond with a 
person who’s confined behind these bars. After a series of tragic events 
I’m serving a life sentence, but I’m in the process of appealing the 
case and I hope to return home someday. That being said, I have plenty 
of free time, and I’m looking for somebody who’s interested in forming 
a lasting friendship.

I’m a calm person with a great sense of humor. I don’t judge, and I find 
that I can usually understand where most people are coming from. 

I’m looking for a woman who also doesn’t judge, and loves herself flaws 
and all. Things like race or age aren’t important to me. Those things 
just don’t matter. I’m a very open person, so I’d like to write to a 
woman who can handle the truth and also be open about herself. I’m hoping 
we can create a one-of-a-kind companionship.

Hello and thanks for taking the time to check out this profile. 
I’ve never tried this before, but I’m interested in it. My name 
is Brad and I’m 24 years old. I love making friends and learning 
deep things about other people.
Some info about me: I absolutely love reading books of all genres. 
I’m equally passionate about movies, and my taste in movies is just 
as wide-ranging. I used to work in a food cart and I’m still in 
love with cooking up great meals for friends or just myself. 
I’m kind of an adrenaline junky, which is why I enjoy roller 
coasters and dirt biking so much, and skydiving was one of 
the best times of my life. I also have a huge soft spot for 
anything four-legged and furry, and I love taking nature walks. 
I love spending time doing anything with the people I love, 
and I also like learning about new friends. Kids crack me up, 
and families are wonderful. I love being silly and trying to 
put a smile on other people’s faces. 
Okay, I appreciate that you spent the time to learn about me. 
Hopefully you can get a feel for what makes me tick. You can 
either write to the address below or email me, whichever is easier. 
Thanks and write back soon!""", "name" : "Brad S."},

my sentence on the beautiful East Coast. They’re holding me 
hostage on charges of treason (haha, I kidin). You can probably

to my people. I’m also a carpenter. I enjoy painting and running too. 
I consider myself an optimist, and I can see the silver lining

LOL. I don’t let this keep me down, and I’m always keeping 
my chin up and looking forward. I really do think I’ll see 
the outside again someday. In the meantime, I’d love to hear 
from people and form some friendships. I’ve never done 
this letter-writing thing before, so you’ll have to forgive me.

I’m a good Christian man who is serving the 12th year of his 
sentence here in MI. Before I went to prison I was devoted 
to the Lord, and I strongly believe that if it were not for 
Him, things would have ended a lot worse. Ever since I got 
here, I’ve been trying to make something productive of my time. 
I’ve finished my G.E.D. and I’m working toward becoming 
skilled in many vocations – I already have four certifications. 
I’m also taking Bible classes online so that I can never 
stop learning God’s message. I have a calming presence for 
other people, and I always think of them first. I think and 
feel things very deeply. I cheer up other people when I’m 
in the room. I’m honest, giving, upstanding, and passionate 
about the people and causes I admire. When I say I’ll get 
something done, I mean it. I’m a good listener and give 
logical advice. I’m also highly analytical, and I tend to 
explore all of the angles of any situation before I make up 
my mind. 
My deep observation skills and strong focus are due in part to 
the fact that I meditate a lot. I think very hard about what 
other people’s motives might be. I genuinely think I make 
better everything I come into contact with. I’d appreciate 
exchange ideas with you about other ways in which I can improve

To begin with I’ve been through some dark times, and that darkness 
has caused me to lash out at other people sometimes. At some point 
a man has to understand who he is and what he desires in his life. 
If you like to go out dancing sometimes, that’s great, but I don’t 
need a girl who’s always at the club. I’m 41 but I’ve never been 
married or fathered a child, and I’d like to meet someone younger 
than me. I’m fit. I love books and I also know that love is 
boundless and that sometimes we have to give up everything to 
find the One. I hope the women out there will be understanding 
about my past just as I’ve learned to understand myself. 
I avoid red meat. My favorite colors, in order, are: silver, 
orange, red, and blue. 
Even though love that isn’t true can take everything out of 
a person, some people are still willing to give themselves 
to it. I’m not one of those people. I’m not young anymore, 
and I’m not looking for a superficial relationship. True 
love is judgment-free and even though it’s hard to right 
some wrongs, love can move mountains that most people are 
too afraid to touch. It’s about much more than a physical or 
financial attraction.
I’d rather find a woman with a healthy body than somebody 
who’s overweight or too thin, but any woman can win me over 
if we connect. Where are my Latina chicas at?!
